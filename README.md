## Goals and objectives

Welcome to Quizmaster, an online quiz that allows the user to select from several categories and test their general knowledge on their chosen subject. With each correct answer selected, the user gains additional points in a score system included in my quiz so that they can clearly see how knowledgeable they are and compare previous results so that they can improve and gain further insight into their specific category.
